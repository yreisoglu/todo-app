# Todo app

### How to start

Project is working with 2 command lines
* First command line is for server side.
    - To run server side open ./server directory and execute `npm install` when the installation completed execute `npm start`
* Second  command line is for client side.
    - To run client side open ./client directory and execute `npm install` when the installation completed execute `npm start`

After following these instructions you can find the website at `http://localhost:3000`
## DB
I chose MongoDB and it's working on cloud so we need to update `.env` file with that I sent you through message.

#### Features
- JWT auth
- MongoDB
- Image and Attachment Upload
- CRUD operations
- Tag filter
- Search

#### Known Issues
We have update endpoint for todos at the backend side but I couldn't implemented that on the client side so todo update is not working.
